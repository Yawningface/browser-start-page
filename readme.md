Browser Start Page is an open source, highly customizable start page (which appears when clicking new tab or when opening the browser) designed to enhance your browsing experience. As a powerful alternative to star.me, it combines the simplicity of marker widgets with the versatility of embed widgets, allowing you to create a personalized dashboard that works just the way you want.

## Usage

- **Marker Widgets:** Easily add, edit, and remove links with custom aliases for quick access.
- **Embed Widgets:** Simply copy the URL of any webpage (e.g., your favorite productivity tool or a pomodoro timer) and embed it into your start page.
- **Customization:** Modify settings, change themes, and organize your dashboard to reflect your unique workflow.

## Getting Started

   **Using NVM:**
   ```sh
   # Install the latest Node.js version (if needed)
   nvm install node

   # Or install a specific version, e.g., 22.12.0
   nvm install 22.12.0

   # Use the installed version
   nvm use 22.12.0
   ```

2. **pnpm:** Install the pnpm package manager globally if you haven't already:
   ```sh
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```
